# UCI Default of Credit Card Clients - AutoML with FLAML

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting **credit card default risk** using the **UCI Default of Credit Card Clients dataset** and **AutoML** techniques with the **FLAML** library. The goal is to automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning for efficient and accurate credit risk prediction.

## Features
- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)** using FLAML
- **Data preprocessing and feature engineering**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Model training and evaluation**
- **Performance comparison with traditional ML models**

## Prerequisites
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn flaml
